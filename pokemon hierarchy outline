/* This file contains the outline of the pokemon hierarchy for assignment 3. The pokemon class will be the superclass of
all pokeon objects to be created. 

  A. Pokemon

        i.blastoise
    2.bulbasaur
      a.ivysaur
        i.venasaur

^^^^^^^^^^^^^abstract classes^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following are going to be interfaces that connect the pokemon's types
1.Water
  a.squirtle
  b.wartortle
  c.blastoise
2.Fire
  a.charmander
  b.charmeleon
  c.charizard ------will have extra interface for flying type.
3.grass/poison
  a.bulbasaur
  b.ivysaur
  c.venasaur

Each type will be used by using the reserved java word implements into the individual pokemon class.
I will be creating these types for the individual pokemon.

NOTE:^^^^^^^^^The first classes(squirtle,charmander,bulbasaur) will implement the type class
and the pokemon evolution states that extends it will inheirt the traits of the types being implemented.
  
EXTRA CREDIT:
  i Will create the eevee pokemon and seperate abstract classes that do not inherit the normal type of eevee.
